# Matrix Implementation
This mini-project was undertaken as a self-practice exercise.
The project definition and tasks were adapted from an old "Introduction to Software Systems" course in the Technion.
In this exercise, I implemented an interface for working with matrices. 
The stages included:

1.Creation of a template class, Vec, for vector operations.

2.Development of Mat, a class template for matrix operations derived from Vec.

3.Development of SqMat for operations on square matrices, derived from Mat.

4.implementing sort algo, Sorting matrix rows in ascending order based on the infinity norm.

5.Integration of complex numbers into matrix operations, including sorting by norm.

**Key takeaways from this project include:**

* Utilizing templates
* Introduction to exception handling
* Understanding abstraction in C++
  
 It is important to note that most of the project files are implemented as header files,
 which was done to align with the assignment's requirements, mainly for the sake of convenience.
 
*Note For Self* - Run more tests.
