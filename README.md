# Matrix Implementation
This mini-project was undertaken as a self-practice exercise.
The project definition and tasks were adapted from an old "Introduction to Software Systems" course in the Technion.
 It is important to note that most of the project files are implemented as header files,
 which was done to align with the assignment's requirements, mainly for the sake of convenience.

*Note For Self* - Run more tests.
